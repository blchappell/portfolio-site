					<p>“I felt like it wouldn’t be fair for me to ask my audience to put themselves out there more and be bolder in their decision making, if I didn’t use this opportunity to take a risk with this project and enable my intent with this.”</p>
					<span class='caption'>—excerpt from my final progress log, April 22nd, 2015 </span>

				 <p class='first'><span class='nested'>As I’ve been wrapping </span>up my final semester at MassArt, I’ve been thinking a lot about how much I’ve grown as a creative in just four years while pursuing my BFA in graphic design. Our final degree project has been the chance to explore our individual curiosities and push ourselves to set our own expectations in a self-driven project. Over the past half year or so, my interests pushed me to not only dive deeper into the technical skills of web development, but also to explore what impacts our overall ambitions in life. By driving my research around the realms of confidence, risk-taking, and resilience, I feel like I’ve learned so much more than what I could’ve learned out of a book or in a classroom. This, in turn, has encouraged a deeper reflection of my own work habits, reservations, and ambitions.</p> 
				<p>	Wayward Bound is the outcome of my final degree project. This is a
					documentation of all stages of my design process, where I’ll be recounting a semester long journey of when I believe to have been successful, where I think I went wrong, my  experimentations, learnings, and any other dirty details that made up this end result. </p>

				<div class="scrolling pull-quote">
					<p>“The content of this feature serves to give my readers a behind-the-scenes view of my thought and perfomance process through this past project.”</p>
				 </div>

					<p>At first, I was going to produce a process book as a separate artifact from my publication, adhering to the requirements of our brief. Although, I found that due to the context of my publication, I have an awesome opportunity to produce this story as an article in the first issue of the magazine. My hope is to not only introduce you to the site, but to demonstrate my overall mission of Wayward Bound: to showcase creative persistence, and resilience in the face of our greatest challenges. I believe one of the ways I could explore this is by exposing my process with total transparency.  
				 	<p>This semester’s felt like both my longest and shortest one yet through the past few years at MassArt. I don’t think I’ve tried to cram so much work in such a brief amount of time in my experience yet. While I don’t feel entirely resolved with the work in Degree Project quite yet, I am happy with what I’ve produced so far, and am confident in where I’ll be able to take it in the future. </p>
				 	<p>Below, I have a content list of how I plan to break down this process, and what each topic will address. Beyond here, most of the content will be a compilation of dated progress logs, journal entries, and captions written at that particular stage in the semester.
